Solutions to Checkio site puzzles

The website [Checkio](http://www.checkio.org) offers a great opportunity to practice and build on python skills by working through various puzzles.  There is a game gimmick and a great way to enter your code to test, etc.  Here is where I will document my attempts to solve the puzzles, these will likely not be the most elegant of solutions but they will be my honest attempts.

Each folder is a separate island on the Checkio site.  Each island has a number of puzzles, you have to earn a certain number of points to unlock other islands.  There seem to be many islands now and this site is just starting out - good site to watch!
